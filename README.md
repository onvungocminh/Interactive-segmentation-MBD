# Interactive-segmentation-MBD
Interactive segmentation using the minimum barrier distance

This project is used for interactive segmentation.
Our method adopts the Minimum Barrier Distance to compute the distance maps
from the background and foreground.
For computing the MBD, we use the approximation approach, called Waterflow MBD [1].
